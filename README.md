this project is an analysis of 1000 companies from the us.
The aim of this project, is to get valuable insights and help administrators and descision makers understand how certain factor/varables(particulaly R&D spending and marketing spend)
in the data collected influences a companies profitability. This will help in better descision making and shed more light on what areas should get an increase or a decrease in funding/resources and what areas
more or less has to be done.

It is also fair to mention that while the afore mentioned factors have some certain level of influece on the level of profitability or the amount of profits of a company, other factors
too also have some considerable amount of influece. The procedures, observations and the outcome of this analysis is a based on the variables profided in the dataset used.

I started by examining and preparing the data, then I made a visual representation all using excel. I then loaded the data into jupyter notebook for further analysis and for evaluation. 
Correlation graphs were also plotted in the notebook. Then a made a model using regression on the dataset to make predictions of profit.
